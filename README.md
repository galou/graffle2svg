# Graffle2Svg Reloaded #

This project is a fork of graffle2svg hosted at [google](http://code.google.com/p/graffle2svg/). *BUT* I changed the whole architecture of the program and added a lot of new features:

 * New shapes: Diamond, Cloud
 * Management of colors and sizes of arrows
 * Bounding box filtering
 * Speed up in processing the graffle file
 * Unicode support
 * Enhanced Text management

All these features were not back ported due to the change of architecture.
